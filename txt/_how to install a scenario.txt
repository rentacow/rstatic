How to install scenarios with Copy/Paste:

1) Create a new text file in your Dangerous Waters\Scenario folder. Rename the file to change its extension (file type) from ".txt" to ".mu"
2) Copy the data for a scenario you want.
3) Paste the data into the .mu file created in step one and save it.

All Done!
